Summary : 
The customer reviews on the e-commerce website have highlighted a number of complaints related to the Cooler Master product. The engineering and design of the product is good, however, there are issues with the quality control for RGB, aluminum frame, switches, and build quality. Additionally, the product is outdated and the software is annoying. The product is suitable for large format cases and water cooling builds, however, there is limited top clearance for 360mm AIO/radiator for push/pull configuration. Furthermore, the entire keyboard flashes red to indicate charging and the keyboard does not wake with the PC. This information is important for the customer service team and the business in order to promote their goals and ensure customer satisfaction.
