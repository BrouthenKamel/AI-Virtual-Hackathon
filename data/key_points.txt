Summary : 
The customer reviews on the e-commerce website have highlighted a number of complaints related to the product. The engineering and design of the product is good, and it is suitable for large format cases and water cooling builds. However, there is limited top clearance for 360mm AIO/radiator for push/pull configuration, and the design is outdated using tooling from 5+ years ago. Additionally, there is poor Quality Control for RGB, unsatisfactory customer service, annoying software, and the entire keyboard flashes red to indicate charging. These complaints need to be addressed in order to improve customer satisfaction and promote the business goals.
