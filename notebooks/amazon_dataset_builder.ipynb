I needed a hobby & a way to satisfy my need to build stuff. Well, I have gone to town on this case and loved it. Most of the black screws it came with are half silver from me taking it apart so many times. The case is big enough to be a sort of 'blank canvas' for just about any configuration you can imagine, albeit with some limitations: I think it's a bit small for a 16mm OD PETG custom loop; I wish it had been designed to support bottom intake fans; and the top clearance for a 360mm AIO/radiator is too small for a push/pull configuration. Keep in mind if you continue to read, I am running an overclocked i9-10900K & need as much cooling capability as possible (with all case parts still properly attached, of course)\"\n",

This case does help keep things cool. A 31 degree difference on my rig. Cable management is not bad. Compared to a 100R, its superbly fantastic! Plenty of room to build in. Now the bad. Less than 24 hours after getting everything put together, the rgb on the front fans quit. Well 1 blue light on the top fan works but wont change in any way. The fans do still run but 1 had a wobble in it from the get go. Contacted Cooler Master and they say that I'm trying to run too many fans. I'm running the 2 front fans the case came with as well as the rear exhaust fan the case came with. Too many, I think not! They say they are sorry for any problems that I may be experiencing with their product. No offer to send me two more fans, which I sent pictures showing the issue, the don't seems to care and have stopped responding to me. With that kind of customer service they should be run out of business. A shame really. I like the case, but will be sending it back and looking into another manufacturer who has a better customer service. Secondly, for reasons I can explain I have had 3 blue screens and 2 random restarts after using this case. I've checked for something shorting out, standoff in the wrong place, anything that could be causing this. Nothing. Even reseated the ram and cpu. No improvement. Put everything back in my 100R and it works flawlessly. Runs hotter but works perfect. Don't know if something in the front ports are wacky or what. I think the thing is cursed. Bye Bye Cooler Master and Thanks for nothing!!!\"\n",

It's a bit smaller than mice that I've used, but is nice and lightweight, and feels good in my hand. I use a hybrid claw/palm grip, and have fairly large hands. I was able to comfortably use this mouse. The software for it is pretty decent, and I was able to configure it to my likings without any issues. The software did require that a firmware update be pushed before I could use it, which I appreciate as I always want to be on the latest firmware for my peripherals.\"\n",
